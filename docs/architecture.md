## Core Abstractions

### Two-Level Node Model (inspired by AFlow)

- **Operator (atomic):** Single LLM call, API call, code execution, database query, or conditional. The fundamental unit. Each operator independently specifies its model.
- **Agent (composite):** A group of operators wired into a sub-graph that behaves as a single unit with a defined interface (input schema → output schema). Inspectable — double-click to zoom into internal graph.

### Typed Edges (inspired by supply chain management)

| Edge Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Data edge** | Structured output of node A feeds node B. Validated with JSON Schema at design time. |
| **Control edge** | Conditional routing (if/else), loops (for-each, while), parallel fan-out/fan-in, retry logic. |
| **Context edge** | Shared memory or state (conversation history, accumulated knowledge, file system) readable/writable by multiple agents. |

### Control-Flow Primitives

| Primitive | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| If/Else | Route based on condition evaluated on upstream data |
| While Loop | Repeat until condition met or max iterations reached |
| For-Each / Map | Fan-out: apply sub-graph to each item in a list, in parallel |
| Reduce | Fan-in: aggregate results from parallel branches |
| Router | LLM-powered routing — model decides which branch |
| Human-in-the-Loop | Pause execution, wait for human input, resume |

### Model Heterogeneity

Each operator node independently specifies its model. Cheap/fast for classification, strong for reasoning, code-specialized for generation. First-class design principle, not afterthought.

### Output Normalization (built-in)

Like batch normalization in DNNs, every LLM operator has a deterministic, built-in output normalization layer: parse → validate against output schema → re-prompt with error on failure → retry up to N times. This is automatic (not a user-visible node) and guarantees every data edge carries schema-valid data or an explicit error.

### Error Handling / Retry Policy

Every operator carries a `retry_policy`: `max_retries`, `backoff`, `fallback_model`, `on_failure` (error / skip / halt). Separate from output normalization — this handles call-level failures (rate limits, timeouts, network errors).

### Checkpointing / Resumability

After each topological level completes, the engine persists outputs, artifact state, context store snapshot, and execution pointer. On restart, resumes from the last completed level.

### Four-Layer Context Model

Direct edge data handles simple input/output. Growing payloads, shared state, and dynamic updates are handled by four distinct layers:

| Layer | What It Holds | Scope | Mutability |
|-------|--------------|-------|------------|
| **1. Edge Data** | Typed, bounded payloads on data edges | Between two nodes | Immutable per edge |
| **2. Node-Local State** | Private working memory (iteration history, convergence metrics) | Scoped to a composite agent / loop | Mutable within scope, invisible to parent |
| **3. Shared Context Store** | Namespaced key-value blackboard (`context.outline`, `context.bibliography`) | Graph-wide, opt-in via declared `read_set` / `write_set` | Mutable; write modes: `write`, `append` |
| **4. Artifact Store** | Large objects (drafts, datasets, figures) stored by reference | Graph-wide | Immutable (new version per revision) |

### Context Projection

At every scope boundary (entering a sub-graph, entering a loop iteration), a **projection function** extracts only what the next consumer needs. Each consumer gets a minimal view — the loop controller sees only iteration count + convergence metrics, the reviser sees only current draft + latest comments, the parent graph sees only the final output.

### Composite Node Contract

Every composite/loop node declares:
- `external_input_schema` / `external_output_schema` — what the parent sees
- `control_state` — iteration count, stop flags, thresholds (loop controller only)
- `local_working_set` — latest working data, not full history
- `read_set` / `write_set` — declared dependencies on shared context store
- `compaction_rule` — how local history is summarized between iterations

### Context Policies

- **Mutation**: nodes read shared context by default; writes require declaration
- **Parallel merge**: fan-out branches must specify merge rules (append, last-write-wins, or reducer node)
- **Compaction**: configurable per composite node (sliding window, summarization gate, diff-based)
- **Failure exits**: `max_iterations`, `stagnation`, `timeout`

### Context Scoping Across Agent Boundaries

The four-layer context model describes *what kinds* of context exist. Context *scoping* describes *where* context is visible when agents are nested (agents containing sub-agents containing sub-sub-agents).

Four scopes govern visibility at every nesting level:

| Scope | Analogy | Direction | What It Holds |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **global** | Global variable | Everywhere (read by all layers) | Codebase index, conversation history, workspace config, rules |
| **local** | Local variable | Stays at current layer | Working memory, retry counts, loop counters, chain-of-thought |
| **pass_down** | Function arguments | Parent → child | Task description, relevant files, constraints, plan |
| **emit_up** | Return value | Child → parent | Result summary, status, discovered signals |

**`pass_down` is explicit, not inherited.** A parent doesn't dump its local context to children. Each child declares an input schema — only what it needs crosses the boundary. This prevents context pollution.

**`emit_up` is explicit, not leaked.** A child returns a structured output, not its entire working memory. The parent decides what to do with it. This prevents noise.

**`global` is read-heavy, write-careful.** Most nodes only read global context. Writes need declaration and conflict resolution (especially during parallel fan-out).

**`local` is invisible outside.** Bulk of working memory. Dies when the agent finishes.

#### Upward Signals

Not everything emitted upward has the same semantics:

- **Results** — the expected structured output. Schema-validated. Consumed by the immediate parent.
- **Signals** — unexpected discoveries that higher layers should know about. Two sub-types:
  - **Sticky signals** — written to global context (everyone should know). Example: "this codebase uses pnpm, not npm."
  - **Non-sticky signals** — propagate up one layer. The parent decides whether to act, relay further, or discard. Example: "circular import detected in module X."

#### Agent Boundary Contract (revised)

Every agent (composite node) formalizes its boundary:

```python
agent PaperWriter:
  accepts:       { topic: str, papers: Paper[], data: Dataset }   # pass_down schema
  returns:       { draft: LaTeX, figures: Fig[], bib: BibTeX }    # emit_up schema
  reads_global:  [codebase_index, style_rules]                    # global dependencies
  writes_global: []                                               # global mutations
  signals:       [quality_warning, missing_data, style_violation] # possible upward signals
```

This supersedes the earlier composite node contract for cross-layer communication. The original `external_input_schema` / `external_output_schema` / `read_set` / `write_set` still apply for the within-graph four-layer model; the boundary contract adds `signals` and clarifies directional semantics.

### Hyperedges: Skills and Rules

Standard edges connect two nodes. **Hyperedges** connect an arbitrary subset of nodes simultaneously. Skills and rules are modeled as hyperedges — graph-level constructs that apply to multiple nodes at once.

```
            ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
            │  "INFORMS Style Guide" (skill)   │  ← hyperedge
            └──┬──────────┬───────────┬────────┘
               ↓          ↓           ↓
         [section-draft] [citation-fmt] [latex-compile]
```

#### Hyperedge Types

| Type | Semantics | Execution Hook | Example |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Skill** | Adds knowledge/capability to attached nodes | `pre_prompt` — injected into LLM context | "Scientific writing conventions" |
| **Rule (guardrail)** | Constrains behavior | `post_output` + `validation` — checks output | "Never use GPT-3.5 for final output" |
| **Rule (style)** | Enforces consistency | `pre_prompt` — style context injected | "APA 7th edition citations" |
| **Rule (override)** | Intercepts/rewrites | `tool_call` — modifies or blocks tool invocations | "All shell commands require approval" |

#### Attachment Scope

Hyperedges attach to nodes by:

- **Node ID** — specific node (`attach_to: ["section-draft-1"]`)
- **Node type** — all nodes of a type (`attach_to_type: "llm_operator"`)
- **Tags** — user-defined labels (`attach_to_tags: ["writing", "review"]`)
- **Subgraph** — all nodes within a composite (`attach_to_subgraph: "paper-writer"`)

Inheritance: hyperedges on a parent graph propagate to sub-graphs unless explicitly excluded.

#### Precedence

When multiple hyperedges attach to the same node, they compose in order: `policy > rule > skill`. Within the same type, more specific scope wins (node ID > tag > type > subgraph).

#### Why Hyperedges, Not Context Edges

Context edges (Layer 3) carry *data* — key-value pairs that nodes read/write. Hyperedges carry *behavior modifiers* — they change how nodes execute, not what data they consume. A skill doesn't add a key to the shared context store; it modifies the prompt of every node it's attached to. This is a fundamentally different concern.

### HumanNode (Generalized)

The Human-in-the-Loop control-flow primitive is generalized into a first-class node type: `HumanNode`. The human is not outside the graph talking *to* it — the human is a node *in* the graph.

**Interface:** Same as any other node — typed input schema (what to show the human) and typed output schema (what the human provides).

**Behavior:** Execution pauses at a HumanNode. The rendering layer (chat panel, web UI, CLI) presents the input and collects the output. Execution resumes.

**Implications:**

- **Chat is rendering.** The chat panel is a view that renders whichever HumanNode is currently active. Message appears → human types → output flows to the next node.
- **Adjustable autonomy is topology.** Full autopilot = no HumanNodes in the graph. Careful oversight = HumanNode between every agent. Approve only final output = one HumanNode at the end. This is a graph design decision, not a mode switch.
- **Background mode = zero HumanNodes.** A background agent is just a graph with no human nodes. "Check in every N steps" is a HumanNode inside a while-loop with a counter-based conditional.
- **Multi-point interaction.** Different HumanNodes ask different things. One asks "which papers?", another asks "approve this figure?", another asks "accept this draft?". The rendering layer sequences them.
- **Rendering is decoupled.** The same graph runs behind a CLI, a web app, a VS Code extension, or a Jupyter notebook. The rendering surface resolves HumanNode I/O; everything else is identical.

### Four Top-Level Agents Architecture

For application-level systems (coding assistants, research IDEs), a practical architecture is four independent top-level agents sharing a common context layer:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Shared Context Layer                      │
│  (codebase index, conversation history, file state,   │
│   linter output, workspace config, rules, skills)     │
├─────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬──────────────┤
│  Ask Agent  │ Agent Mode  │Debug Agent │ Plan Agent   │
│  (Q&A       │ (ReAct +    │(hypothesis │ (tree search │
│   graph)    │  tools +    │ driven +   │  + outline   │
│             │  fan-out)   │ auto-diag) │  generation) │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴────────────┴──────────────┘
     each is a complex DAN sub-graph internally
```

The shared context layer is **not** part of any graph. It's a read/write store that all four agents access. Each agent internally is a full DAN network with its own working memory and control flow.

**Why four:** These represent fundamentally different control-flow patterns (linear Q&A vs. ReAct loop vs. hypothesis-driven diagnosis vs. tree search), different tool sets, and different stopping conditions.

**Mode switching:** Serialize the active agent's relevant outputs to the shared context layer → activate the new agent → it reads from shared context on startup. The conversation history carries over; the internal working memory does not.

**Context model:**
- **Global** (shared context layer) — codebase index, conversation history, workspace config, session state. All agents read; writes are declared.
- **Local** (within each agent) — the agent's DAN sub-graph manages its own working memory, loop state, intermediate results. Private. Dies when the agent finishes or the user switches modes. Only durable outputs (file changes, conversation messages, plan artifacts) persist to global.
- **pass_down / emit_up** — standard directional scoping within each agent's internal sub-graph.

## Execution Engine (Phase 1)

### Engine API

```python
from dan.engine import Engine, EngineConfig

config = EngineConfig(
    llm_base_url="https://api.vectorengine.ai/v1",
    llm_api_key="...",
    llm_default_model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
)
engine = Engine(config)
result = await engine.run(graph, inputs={"idea": "..."})
result = await engine.resume(graph, run_id="abc123")
```

### Scheduling

- Async-first: `Engine.run()` is async; parallel fan-out uses `asyncio.gather()`
- Kahn's algorithm groups nodes into topological levels; nodes in the same level execute concurrently
- Sub-graph execution is recursive: WhileLoop/ForEach/Composite executors call back into the scheduler

### Executor Protocol

- `NodeExecutor` is a `Protocol` with `async execute(node, inputs, context) -> NodeResult`
- `ExecutorRegistry` maps `node_type` strings to executor instances; users can register custom executors
- Built-in executors for all 10 node types auto-registered on Engine creation

### LLM Integration

- Default executor uses `openai.AsyncOpenAI(base_url=...)` — supports any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- Output normalization built into LLM executor: extract JSON -> validate against schema -> re-prompt with error -> retry
- Transient API errors (rate limits, timeouts) retried with exponential backoff

### Condition Evaluation

- IfElse/WhileLoop `condition` strings evaluated as Python expressions via restricted `eval()`
- No `__builtins__`; whitelist of safe functions (len, min, max, all, any, etc.)
- Variables populated from upstream port data

### Checkpointing

- `CheckpointStore` protocol with filesystem default (`FileSystemCheckpointStore`)
- Checkpoint written after each topological level completes
- `Engine.resume()` loads checkpoint and continues from pending nodes

## Workflow Builder API (Phase 1.5)

### Builder DSL

```python
from dan.builder import workflow, decompile

paper = workflow("paper_writing")
ideas = paper.llm("idea_gen", model="claude-opus-4", prompt="Generate ideas about {topic}")
outline = paper.llm("planner", prompt=f"Create outline for: {ideas}")
ideas >> outline
graph = paper.build()  # -> validated Graph (dan_graph_v1)
code = decompile(graph)  # -> executable Python that reconstructs the graph
```

### Four Connection Mechanisms

1. **f-string magic**: `prompt=f"Use: {ideas}"` — `NodeRef.__format__` emits a compile-time marker `<<dan:node_id:port>>`. The compiler parses prompts, creates DataEdges, and replaces markers with sanitized input port aliases.
2. **`>>` operator**: `a >> b` — DataEdge from default output to default input. Chainable: `a >> b >> c`.
3. **PortRef passing**: `items=node["port"]` — subscript on NodeRef returns PortRef, resolved at compile time.
4. **Explicit edge**: `wf.edge(a["out"], b["in"])` — fully explicit port-to-port wiring.

Builder also supports typed non-data edges: `wf.control_edge(...)` and `wf.context_edge(...)`, plus graph-level artifacts via `wf.artifact_ref(...)`.

### Sub-Graph Context Managers

```python
with wf.while_loop("loop", condition="x < 5", max_iterations=10) as body:
    body.llm("step", ...)
with wf.for_each("fan", items=node["items"], parallelism=4) as body:
    body.code("proc", ...)
with wf.composite("block") as sub:
    sub.llm("inner", ...)
```

### Node-Type Output Contract Map

Each node type has a known default output port matching the runtime executor (e.g., `llm_operator` -> `text`, `for_each` -> `results`, `if_else` -> `branch`). The compiler uses this map for `>>` wiring and f-string marker resolution.

### Decompiler

`decompile(graph: Graph) -> str` produces an executable Python module string. Topological sort with deterministic ordering, chain detection for `>>` sugar, context managers for sub-graph nodes, `NodeRef` wrappers for sub-graph edge wiring. Preserves `ui`, `metadata`, `shared_context`, and all edge types.

## Visual Editor Backend (Phase 2)

### Server Architecture

Local full-stack: FastAPI backend + React Flow frontend. Runs locally like Jupyter — `dan-serve` or `python -m dan.server` starts the server, open `localhost:8000` in browser.

### Engine Event System

- 9 typed events: `run_started`, `run_completed`, `run_failed`, `node_started`, `node_completed`, `node_failed`, `node_skipped`, `node_output`, `log`
- Opt-in `event_callback` parameter on `Engine` constructor — no events emitted if not set (backward compatible)
- Events are fire-and-forget; callback failures never break execution

### Run Manager

- Executes `Engine.run()` / `Engine.resume()` as asyncio background tasks
- Multiplexes events to WebSocket subscribers via async queues
- Catch-up snapshot on subscribe: current node statuses + buffered recent events (up to 500)
- Tracks active/completed runs with status snapshots

### Graph Persistence

- Filesystem-based: JSON files in `./graphs/` directory
- `last_opened` tracking for auto-load on editor open
- `dan_graph_v1` JSON contract unchanged — the backend reads/writes the same format

## Visual Editor Frontend (Phase 2)

### DAN <-> React Flow Adapter

Bidirectional conversion layer (`graphAdapter.ts`):
- DAN `input_ports`/`output_ports` map to React Flow handles via `port:<name>` ID convention
- 3 edge types visually differentiated: data (indigo), control (amber), context (emerald, animated)
- All 10 node types rendered through a single `DanNode` custom component with per-type color coding
- Node execution status shown as colored rings (yellow=running, green=completed, red=failed)

### UI Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GraphSwitcher (graph list, create, delete)      │
│  RunPanel (save, run, resume, disconnect, status)│
├──────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────┤
│      │                             │             │
│ Node │      GraphCanvas            │  Config     │

│      │ Logs | Output               │             │

└──────┴─────────────────────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### Composite Node Preview

- Nodes with `body_graph` (while_loop, for_each, composite) show a "View Sub-graph" button
- Opens a read-only React Flow modal rendering the referenced sub-graph
- No nested editing — that's Phase 4

## Key Decisions

- **Build, don't buy.** Existing tools (Langflow, Flowise, Dify) cannot handle while-loops, composable sub-graphs, or typed edges natively. See development-plan.md sections 3-4 for full analysis.
- **Code-first, visual-second.** Python builder API is the primary workflow authoring interface. The visual editor reads/writes the same graph JSON. Both are first-class, but code comes first.
- **Language split.** Python for orchestration runtime and validation; TypeScript for the visual editor and interaction layer.
- **Roadmap resequencing.** Build the core engine first, then immediately build a full visual editor baseline to test the system early via UI.
- **Hierarchical plan numbering.** Plan files use hierarchical numbering (`1-name`, `1-1-name`, `1-1-1-name`) to mirror the task tree.
